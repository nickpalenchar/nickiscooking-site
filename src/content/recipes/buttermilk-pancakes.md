ingredients:
  - '2 cup All Purpose Flour'
  - '3 tbsp sugar'
  - 1.5 tsp baking powder
  - 1.5 tsp baking soda
  - 1.25 tsp kosher salt
  - 2.5 cups buttermilk
  - 2 large eggs
  - 3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, plus more for pan.
steps:
  - '**Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a medium-large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt.'
  - '**Add Wet Ingredients**: Make a well in the center, add the buttermilk. Slowly push outer dry ingredients into the buttermilk and stir until incorporated.'
  - '**Add the rest**: Stir in eggs and butter.'
  - '**Get Cooking:** Set a medium non-stick skillet over medium-low to medium heat. Add a small amount of butter and scoop a ladle of batter in the middle. No need to swirl the pan around (the batter will move outward on its own). Let cook until bubbles form and break at the top of the batter.'
  - '**Prepare to flip**: Pressing down into the pan, slide a spatula under the pancake (if it feels fragile, slide back out and wait another 45 seconds). Flipping from the pan to give some momentum, lift the spatula and flip the pancake over. Cook another 1-2 minutes.'
  - '**Serve:** Slide the pancake off the pan onto a plate. Eat immediately, or leave in the oven on warm until ready to serve.'
tips:
  - Pancakes are all about heat of the pan. If the butter is bubbling a little bit when it hits the pan, the temp is perfect. You may need to make a few to figure out the temp exactly.
  - My preferred way to butter the pan is to just take a stick and rub into the middle of the pan.
