ingredients:
  - Whole Parmesan
steps:
  - '**Preheat Oven** To {temp 375}'
  - '**Prepare Cooking Sheet**: Line a cooking sheet with parchment paper.'
  - '**Shred Parmesan**: using a cheese grater, shred about 1/2 cup of parmesan.'
  - '**Arrange Crisps**: Arrange mounds of parmesan in generous pinches using your thumb and two other fingers.'
  - '**Bake**: 5-7 minutes, until crisps are _slightly_ darker.'
  - '**Remove and cool**: remove from the oven and lift up parchment paper with crisps. Place on counter and let cool for 2 minutes.'
tips:
  - Avoid pre-shredded parmesan as it may have additives that will prevent the cheese from sticking together.
  - "**Crisps overcook fast**: When starting, it's better to undercook. If a few crisps are a bit white in the center but the rest have sightly browned, it's probably best to remove."
addendum:
  - storage: Store in an air-tight container at room temperature fo 5-7 days.
